    <p>
    In our world today, you would agree with me that … <strong> Success is often measured by output, visibility, and momentum. </strong>
    </p>


    <p>
    While this approach can yield results, it often leaves little room to ask deeper 
    and <em> maybe more profound </em> questions about sustainability, identity, and maybe our internal health. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I have had this series in mind for a while, and the goal is to use it to try and shift something in us. 
    With it, we’ll explore what it means to be a wholesome creative, that is, 
    one whose growth is not only visible on the outside but stable on the inside.
    </p>
    
    <p><em>Sounds serious shey, i know.</em> </p>

    <p>One thing to keep in mind is that, long-term career and self impact
    is not solely based on productivity; it also requires wholeness.</p>

    <p>
    Sooo, let’s start 😎
    </p>

    <div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 3rem auto; text-align: center;">
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #4a4a4a; ">

    <h2>
    What Does a Balanced and Whole Creative Look Like?
    </h2>

    <p>
    To make this practical, we need a yardstick. 
    Something we can actually reflect on and measure our wholeness with. 
    Here are a few characteristics that are commonly found in a balanced and whole creative individual:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> <strong>The person is at Peace while being productive -</strong> The ability to rest without guilt or anxiety.</li>
        <li> <strong>The person’s Consistency has a measured level of intensity -</strong> A pace that can be sustained beyond short bursts of effort.</li>
        <li> <strong>There is strong Alignment between values and output -</strong> Conviction is seen in their work/deliverables.</li>
        <li> <strong>Their Identity is beyond only results.</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>They posses good Emotional and mental stability.</strong> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    These indicators/characteristics may not appear on dashboards, but they determine longevity. 
    In short, they are almost not measured with numbers only through deep reflections.
    <p>

    </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>
    It’s Important to note that wholeness isn’t the absence of struggle
    </h2>

    <p>
    Oh yesss, wholeness does not mean a life free from pressure, 
    doubt, or fatigue. Struggle is an inevitable part of growth and creative work.
    </p>

    <p>
    What distinguishes a balanced/whole creative from another <em<(for fear of using the word “broken”)</em> 
    is not the absence of difficulty, but the capacity to carry it without internal collapse. 
    Wholeness allows tension without disintegration.
    </p>

    <p>
    A <strong> balanced/whole creative </strong> can encounter pressure without losing their stability. 
    Not the one that gives up on work or productive things by tuesday.

    This first part of this series is about definition, not resolution
    </p>

    <p>
    In the next part, we will shift focus toward identity and ask a necessary question: 
    <strong> Using deep reflection, how close am i to being a balanced/whole creative? </strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
