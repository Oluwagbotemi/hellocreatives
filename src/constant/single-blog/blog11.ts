        Building from Nigeria doesn’t mean staying limited. With intention and consistency, 
        our creativity can travel beyond borders while opening us to fresh experiences, 
        learning curves, and opportunities.

    <p>
    Are you building your career from a place like Nigeria? 
    </p>

    <p> 
    Does it sometimes feel like the resources, opportunities, 
    or access you need are out of reach simply because of location or nationality?
    </p>

    <p>
    For a while, I felt the same way. There are opportunities 
    I’ve wanted to pursue (and even applied for) that weren’t 
    available to me—not because I wasn’t qualified, but because of where I come from.
    </p>

    <p>
    But I’m not here to complain. I’m here to share the small but deliberate steps 
    I’m taking to <strong>export my talent beyond Nigeria,</strong> 
    even with the mental limitations that comes with holding the green passport.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Here are some of the commitments I’m making—and still learning to refine:
    </p>

    <h4>
    1. Showing up in communities (both local and international).
    </h4>
    <p>
    It’s easy to stay in your bubble, but real growth happens 
    when you engage with people outside your comfort zone. 
    Communities expose you to new ways of thinking and working.
    </p>

    <h4>
    2. Talking more about my work and showing it.
    </h4>
    <p>
    For me, that looks like sharing mockups, projects, 
    and ideas online—rather than spending my energy only 
    on online bants (fun sometimes, I can’t lie 😂). Visibility matters.
    </p>
  
    <h4>
    3. Investing in better tools for access.
    </h4>
    <p>
    One of my first steps was subscribing to LinkedIn Premium. It’s still early days, 
    but I’ve already started seeing how much wider my reach can be when I engage more intentionally. 
    I’ve also started leaving thoughtful, real-time comments to spark conversations and 
    build connections with people from different environments.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    For you, the how might look different. That’s fine. The point isn’t to copy my steps—it’s to 
    take intentional ones of your own. Try something new, refine your approach, and be consistent. 
    Prioritise growth, stay curious, and keep learning—not just trends, but newer systems and ways of doing things.
    </p>

    <p>
    I’m still figuring this out. I’m learning, unlearning, and re-learning. But what’s clear is this: 
    the more we commit to pushing our creative work beyond borders, the more we open ourselves up to 
    new experiences, new opportunities, and new growth curves.
    </p>

    <p>
    And honestly? I look forward to seeing our talents shine in newer environments.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    With you,

    P.S: If this resonated with you, share it with a creative friend who might be bumping up against their own ceiling.
