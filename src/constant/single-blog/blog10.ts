    Hey friend,
    </p>

    <p>
    There’s been a lot of conversation online lately, especially on Twitter, 
    about NEPO babies (those born into access and privilege) and LAPO babies 
    (those who weren’t). Some of it is funny, some of it uncomfortable, and a lot of it true.
    </p>

    <p>
    The core of the conversation is simple: <strong>not everyone starts life from the same place.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Some people are born into networks, capital, legacy, and opportunity. 
    Others start with grit, a public school education, and a prayer.
    </p>

    <p>
    And if you’re someone who wasn’t handed a head start, 
    it’s easy to look around and wonder, “Will I ever catch up?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Before we go ahead, let me say this clearly: <strong>you’re not at a disadvantage. Your path is only different.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    It’s frustrating. It’s unfair. And it’s true. But if we let what we can’t control define us, 
    we’ll never use the power of what we can and the blessed thing about life is that in 
    that frustrating and unfair reality lies our strength, which are things we can control:
    </p>

    <h4>
    1. How you choose to show up:
    </h4>
    <p>
    Your consistency, integrity, and work ethic define you. And while it may take longer to be seen, it will always speak.
    </p>

    <h4>
    2. How you steward what you have
    </h4>
    <p>
    Some people waste opportunities because they were handed too many. 
    Others stretch one open door into a whole building. Stewardship over status, every time.
    </p>

    <h4>
    3. What you choose to build
    </h4>
    <p>
    Whether it’s your personal brand, your community, or your skillset, what you build becomes your leverage. 
    Start where you are. Build slowly. Build well. <em>(Read:

    </p>

    <h4>
    4. The story you tell yourself
    </h4>
    <p>
    You are not less capable because your journey looks different. 
    You’re not a failure because your success didn’t come fast. 
    Don’t let other people’s timelines make you doubt your own process.
    </p>

    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
    The NEPO vs LAPO conversation is important. It reveals systemic truths. Buttt, it’s not the full picture.
    </p>

    <p>
    No matter where you started, your journey matters. 
    Your story counts. And your progress is valid. 
    Because while we don’t all start in the same place, we all deserve the chance to move forward.
    </p>

    <p>
    With you,
    </p>
    <p style="font-style: bold;">
