    Today, we start off with a question a number of persons would want answered now or maybe in the future:
    </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 16px; border-left: 4px solid #4F46E5; border-radius: 6px;">
    Is a tech career stagnancy a thing?
    </p>

    <p>
    The answer is Yes—though it largely depends on the metrics we use to define growth, 
    both personally and within society. Some common indicators people use include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Regular Salary Increases</li>
        <li>Job Title Changes (such as promotions within a company’s hierarchy)</li>
    </ul>

    <div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 3rem auto; text-align: center;">
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #4a4a4a; ">
        ----------
    </p>
    </div>

    <div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 3rem auto; text-align: center;">
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #4a4a4a; ">
        To get a sense of where you stand in your career, 
        platforms like Payscale.com and Glassdoor.com offer 
        insights into industry salary expectations and common job titles.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 3rem auto; text-align: center;">
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #4a4a4a; ">
        ----------
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
    These traditional metrics—like salary bumps and new job titles—are super 
    important because they not only provide benchmarks for comparison against 
    industry standards but also show you what's possible and where you might 
    fit in the job market.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, they do not always tell the whole story because relying solely on 
    these indicators can be misleading because they may not necessarily reflect 
    your skills or the real impact you’re making within your company.
    </p>

    <p>
    As creatives with growth-driven mindsets, the focus should shift to two critical areas:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The quality of your skills</li>
        <li>The value your skills bring to the business (i.e., how many solutions are you creating, and how impactful are they?)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    One truth we will come to know is that if you continuously improve in these areas, promotions and salary increments will naturally follow.
    </p>

    <h4>
    Your Takeaway
    </h4>

    <p>
    By concentrating on skill development and the value you add to your company, 
    you can ensure lasting career growth—without being solely reliant on 
    traditional metrics like job titles or salaries.
