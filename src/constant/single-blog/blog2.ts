    As a growth driven individual, it is easy to get lost in the hunt for the next big break or the completion of the next course. 
    This is an incredibly rewarding way of life because your chances of success increases based on your focus.
    </p>

    <p>
    It takes an interesting turn when it feels/looks like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>There’s no achievement in sight,</li>
        <li>You are inadequate (imposter syndrome, maybe),</li>
        <li>There’s no energy/motivation to pursue after your goal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    These phases are bound to come up every once in a while. 
    In fact, you may be going through it currently. 
    Gratitude Journaling is my recommended solution for you. 
    It basically involves you (and me) writing down all our achievements 
    and events we are grateful for. Whether big or small,.
    </p>

    <p>
    It’s that book/page/document you open when you need a reminder, new energy or motivation. 
    It is that book where you store all the screenshots of praise you get on LinkedIn, Twitter, and the likes.
    </p>

            style="
            display: block;
            width: 75vw;
            max-width: 45%;
            aspect-ratio: 100%;
            object-fit: fill;
            margin: 0 auto;
            border-radius: 6px;

    <p>
    Expectedly, some of us may be saying in our minds that there’s 
    nothing worth celebrating or good to write/journal about. 
    I believe the word or phrase for that is "ingratitude."
    </p>

    <h2>
    <em>Please do not go away, I mean well.</em>
    </h2>

    <p>
    Take sometime today, which could be as small as 5–10 minutes, 
    to think about your career/journey. You will come to realize the 
    number of achievements you have made. They may be small and as 
    simple as successfully finishing a YouTube video.
    </p>

    <h2>
    <em>A quote for you:</em>
    </h2>

    <h2>
    <em>We often take for granted the very little things that deserve the most gratitude, 
    even when they turn out to be the bedrock of bigger and louder achievements.</em>
    </h2>

    <p>
    Dear Creative (you, my reader), take some time to journal today. Some key notes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Journal/Document on the spot</li>
        <li>Every praise you get is valuable. Screenshot and document them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    In closing, remember that gratitude is the spark that ignites progress. 
    With you embracing gratitude journaling, your focus will shift from what's 
    lacking to what you've already accomplished, 
    thereby breeding a more positive and productive mindset. 
    Take the first step today and start celebrating your wins, 
    no matter how small they may seem. 
    Your growth and success may just depend on it.
    </p>
