    As creatives, we often find ourselves filled with the idea of instant results and comparisons. 
    We imagine a masterpiece logo design, course, and we want it done with speed of light. 
    However, true growth and fulfillment rarely grows from rushed success. 
    Instead, they emerge from the journey itself—the process of transforming an idea into reality.
    </p>

    <p>
    A book i love so much, "Stay In Your Process," Dr. Akin Akinpelu best explains Process, 
    highlighting the crucial distinction between Mental Creation and Physical Creation. 
    Dr Akin Akinpelu shared that Mental Creation is the spark of imagination, 
    where ideas are born in our minds. Physical Creation, on the other hand, 
    is the execution of those ideas, bringing them to life for others to experience.
    </p>

    <p>
    The gap between these two stages is where the magic happens. 
    It's the space where we refine our ideas, learn from our mistakes, and iterate towards excellence. 
    Consider a digital designer, for instance, who thinks of creating a meaningful logo. 
    They may use Figma (the community favourite 😍) to bring their idea to life, 
    but we will come to find out that the initial iterations may fall short of their vision. 
    Yet, with persistence and dedication, they eventually craft a physical creation that resonates with their audience.
    </p>

    By staying in our process, we allow ourselves to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Embrace the journey, rather than fixating on the destination,</li>
        <li>Learn, relearn, and unlearn, as needed,</li>
        <li>Cultivate a growth mindset, where we are continuously focused on progress over perfection,</li>
        <li>Trust in the unfolding of our vision, even when the outcome is uncertain.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    In a world that often celebrates overnight successes and quick fixes, "Stay In Your Process" 
    serves as a timely reminder that true creativity and fulfillment arise from the journey, 
    not just the end result. So, let's embrace our processes, trust in our growth, and 
    find joy in the creative journey.
