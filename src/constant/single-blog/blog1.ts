    Let me be honest, there are moments I’ve set goals, created the best plans, 
    even committed to getting the work done … and oh well, I still didn’t follow through.
    </p>
    <p>
    And for the longest time, I did think it was a discipline problem on my part.
    </p>
    <p>
    But recently, I came across something called the Upper Limit Problem in a book titled “The Mountain Is You“.
    </p>

    Psychologists say it is a concept that explains this invisible ceiling we sometimes 
    hit when things start to go too well. 
    It’s that internal alarm that goes off when we begin to experience success, peace, or progress 
    beyond what we’re used to. The result? We pull back. We self-sabotage. We shrink.
    And the worst or tricky part? Most times, we don’t even realise that we are self-sabotaging.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here’s what it will normally look like:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>• You’re consistent for a while… and then begin ghosting your own process.</li>
        <li>• You start strong on a new project… but then procrastinate on the important parts.</li>
        <li>• You set goals and make plans… but then find excuses not to follow through.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    For most people they advice will be “just be more disciplined.” 
    But what I’m learning is that you need more desire. clear and meaningful desire.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is because meaningful desire gives direction. 
    Discipline only kicks in when you’ve convinced your heart that something is truly worth it.
