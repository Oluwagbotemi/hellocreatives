        Growth at mid-level isn’t about consuming more content. 
        It is more about intentional exploration, curiosity, and ownership. 
        Let’s talk about what it really takes to level up.
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
    These days <em>(translate to the last 1 year 🫠),</em> my desire to grow has led me to a moment of clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
    You'll agree with me that, when we were just starting out, it was simple to figure out what to learn next. 
    The plan was easy to understand. There were videos, online classes, and many other tools that were very much 
    available for beginners to use and helped you move on to the next skill. It was easier and more 
    straightforward when it came to knowing if you were growing.
    </p>

    <p>
    But now? As maybe a mid-level creative or just someone looking to grow past the norm, 
    I find that most of the virtual masterclasses and courses are starting to sound the same. 
    It’s like they’re all remixing the same information and selling it in different wrappers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    What I had to do was pause and do a bit of introspection. This introspection has gone on for months. 
    In it, I then realized something important: the path to senior isn’t laid out like the one to mid-level. 
    It requires a different kind of learning. In a simplier way, What Got Me Here Won’t Take Me There. 
    This growth path is one that involves ownership, initiative, and a whole lot of curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
    For clarity reasons and knowing that you will want to grow as well, here are some things to keep at heart:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The Plateau Is Real: At this point, growth isn't about tools, it's about how you think and lead.</li>
        <li>Change from "Doer" to "Driver": Skills alone won't do. You need to start thinking about systems and how to solve problems.</li>
        <li>Let Your Curiosity Guide You: Questions, projects, and deep dives are better than classes for teaching.</li>
        <li>Don't wait for someone to give you a map; make your own. Go ahead and do things, and think about them often.</li>
        <li>Ask more useful questions: "Who am I becoming?" should be used instead of "What should I learn next?" That shift makes everything possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Last but not least, you're not behind. As long as you ask the right questions and show up on purpose, 
    you're not behind. You're growing, even if you can't see it right now.
    </p>

    <p>
    Keep growing.
