    Hey heyyy, Jeremiah here.
    </p>

    <p>
    Thirty-something days into 2025 and, and I'm already feeling the 
    pressure of some of the goals and targets I set for myself this year. 
    I made a promise to be more intentional and consistent, and 
    if you're feeling the same, then this newsletter is for you.
    </p>

        I recently wrote about <a href="https://hellocreatives.substack.com/p/this-year-is-yours-to-own-make-everyday">
        “Taking Ownership”</a> (I promise, e makes sense!).

    <p>
    To the order of the day, are a few things that have helped me show up consistently:
    </p>

    <h4>
    1. Prioritize and Commit:
    </h4>
    <p>
    I make it a point to remind myself why I started and what might happen if I don’t stick to my goals. 
    That little mental nudge goes a long way in keeping me focused.
    </p>

    <h4>
    2. Keep Your Goals Visible:
    </h4>
    <p>
    Inasmuch as I have felt the pressure of achieving the goal I set, 
    looking at them (in my journal) daily has helped. Whether 
    it’s printing them out and putting them on my wall or revisiting them before bed, 
    seeing them regularly will definitely help you stay on track.
    </p>

    <h4>
    3. Take Ownership:
    </h4>
    <p>
    ake i no lie give you, the truth is, no one is coming to save us. 
    If we want to achieve anything, it has to start with our own conscious effort. 
    <a href="">Ownership</a>https://hellocreatives.substack.com/p/this-year-is-yours-to-own-make-everyday is very key, 
    and it's a topic I explored in my previous piece on the subject.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, if we are being honest, discipline and consistency go hand in hand. 
    Without discipline, maintaining consistency can be pretty challenging.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Here’s to making every day count in 2025, one intentional step at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Cheers,
    </p>
