    body: `
    <p>
    Let me be honest, there are moments I’ve set goals, created the best plans, 
    even committed to getting the work done … and oh well, I still didn’t follow through.
    </p>

    <p>
    And for the longest time, I did think it was a discipline problem on my part.
    </p>

    <p>
    But recently, I came across something called the Upper Limit Problem in a book titled “The Mountain Is You“. 
    Psychologists say it is a concept that explains this invisible ceiling we sometimes hit when things start to go too well. 
    It’s that internal alarm that goes off when we begin to experience success, peace, or progress 
    beyond what we’re used to. The result? We pull back. We self-sabotage. We shrink. 
    And the worst or tricky part? Most times, we don’t even realise that we are self-sabotaging.
    </p>

    <h4>
    Here’s what it will normally look like:
    </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>You’re consistent for a while… and then begin ghosting your own process.</li>
        <li>You start strong on a new project… but then procrastinate on the important parts.</li>
        <li>You set goals and make plans… but then find excuses not to follow through.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    For most people they advice will be “just be more disciplined.” 
    But what I’m learning is that you need more desire. clear and meaningful desire.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is because meaningful desire gives direction. 
    Discipline only kicks in when you’ve convinced your heart that something is truly worth it.

    Before I go, here are recommendations that I predict will help us push past our upper limits:
    </p>

    <h4>
    1. Get Clear on Our Why:
    </h4>
    <p>
    When we feel stuck, which will happen often, our initial action should be to revisit the reason we started. 
    This should be the deeply personal version, not the fancy one.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 16px; border-left: 4px solid #4F46E5; border-radius: 6px;">
    For me, my why behind Hello Creatives is to fuel the feeling of offering some of value in this world. That’s my anchor.
    </p>

    <h4>
    2. Notice The Pattern:
    </h4>
    <p>
    Start paying attention to the moments we slow down right after a win. 
    That dip? That sudden “meh” feeling? That’s the Upper Limit showing up.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 16px; border-left: 4px solid #4F46E5; border-radius: 6px;">
    At this point, we’ll need to start seeing success just the same way we see failure. An opportunity to do better, not an opportunity to relax.
    </p>

    <h4>
    3. Don’t Just Push Through, Lean In:
    </h4>
    <p>
    Forcing our way through it may work but an even better way is to simple, Question it. 
    For example, ask: “What am I afraid of if this goes well?”
    </p>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 16px; border-left: 4px solid #4F46E5; border-radius: 6px;">
    Lately, for me, my answer has revolved around: “I don’t know who I’d be at that level.”
    </p>



    <h4>
    4. Then, Visualize the New Normal:
    </h4>
    <p>
    Train your mind to feel safe in success. 
    Imagine yourself showing up fully, receiving more, and still being grounded. 
    It helps expand what you believe is “normal” for you.
    </p>

    <h4>
    5. Finally, Desire-First Habits:
    </h4>
    <p>
    At every point, we should always as “Do I really want this?” 
    If yes, great. If no, figure out why. Desire pulls. Discipline drags. 
    Build habits that are aligned with your pull.
    </p>

        You’ve just hit your upper limit. But the beautiful thing? It’s not a wall
        but a ceiling and ceilings can be raised.
